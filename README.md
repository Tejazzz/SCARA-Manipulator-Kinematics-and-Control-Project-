# SCARA-Manipulator-Kinematics-and-Control-Project-

SCARA Manipulator Kinematics and Control Project: Matlab/Simulink (10/2022-12/2022)

● Performed kinematic inversion algorithms by generating a trajectory in the robot operational space with trapezoidal
velocity profile and developed an inverse-dynamic control approach for a 5 kg load.

● Achieved an average error of less than 1 degree in joint angles using the Jacobian inverse method by reducing
obstacle collisions by 75% using the second-order inversion algorithm.
